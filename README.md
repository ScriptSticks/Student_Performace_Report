### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution" & "column quality" options.
- Step 3 : By default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present. Data was published to the main visualization pane.
- Step 5 : Various visuals were used to identify different pattern, trends and convey insights.

##  Distribution of Gradeclass, Proportion of Gender & Total Record:

A card visual was used to represent total number of students, total number  and percentages of male and female in the report.  A bar chart is used to represent the distribution of grades. This shows the total number of student in the record. Female has a higher than Male students. 
Gradeclass distribution shows over 50% of the students had grade F while 4.5% had grade A.
