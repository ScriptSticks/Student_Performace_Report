- Step 3 : By default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present. Data was published to the main visualization pane.
- Step 5 : 9 visuals were added to convey different pattern, trends and insights.
